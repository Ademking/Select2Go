# Select2Go
(Google Chrome Extension) Select2Go is an open-source Google Chrome extension.

When browsing the web and you find a username that you want to open, just select the text and right click on it and Select2Go will open a new tab with the username.
Select2Go is very useful for opening social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, linkedIn, GitHub, TikTok, etc...). It saves you time because without this extension, you have to open the website and search for the username. 

This is a great extension for people who always want to follow someone but forget their username. It works like this: You’re checking out a website and you see a username. You’re like, “I really should follow him/her” and then you forget the username. With this extension you just select the username and it will open it in a new tab.
